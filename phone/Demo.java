//n this assignment you will be processing employee data. You have a number of employees (that number determined by user input).
//        You will be recording each employee’s name, salary, and telephone number, as well as any other data you need or think is
//        appropriate. It is important that you record the employee telephone number in valid form, therefore you will develop two
//        exception classes.
//
//        You will be developing the following classes:
//
//        The class Employee which will be derived from the class Person (linked here: Person.java).
//        Preview the document The class Employee should have constructors, accessor methods, mutator
//        methods a toSting method, an equals method and any additional methods you feel necessary.
//        Every Employee object should record the employee’s name, salary, and telephone number, as
//        well as any other data you need or think is appropriate.
//        The class TelephoneNumberLengthException for when the telephone number entered—without dashes
//        or spaces—is not exactly ten digits. When an exception is thrown, the user should be reminded o
//        f what she or he entered, told why it is inappropriate, and asked to reenter the data.
//        The class TelephoneNumberCharacterException for when any character in the telephone number is not
//        a digit. When an exception is thrown, the user should be reminded of what she or he entered,
//        told why it is inappropriate, and asked to reenter the data. The class DemoTelephoneNumber_yourInitials.java
//        (where yourInitials represent your initials), a driver a program to enter employee data, including telephone
//        number and salary, into an array. The maximum number of employees is 100, but your program should also work
//        for any number of employees less than 100. After all data has been entered, your program should display the r
//        ecords for all employees, with an annotation stating whether the employee’s salary is above
//        or below average. Submit all 4 files.
